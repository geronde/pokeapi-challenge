This application was made for a challenge. You can view a working demo from [here](https://geronde.github.io/pokeapi-challenge/)

## Stack

I chose to work in react as per the requirment for the challenge. And as per the recommendation, I've worked with minimal dependencies. These are:
- react-router: to handle application routing
- styled-component: easy and efficient way to style components
- react-loader-spinner: Loader for react

## Nice to have
Since the challenge was timed, there have been many other tasks/work to accomplish more, such as:
- Internalization
- Unit testing
- Code coverage
- Linting
- Continuous integration
