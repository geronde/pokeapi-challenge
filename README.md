This application was made for a challenge. You can view a working demo from (here)[]

## Stack

I chose to work in react as per the requirment for the challenge. And as per the recommendation, I've worked with minimal dependencies. These are:
react-router: to handle application routing
styled-component: easy and efficient way to style components
react-loader-spinner: Loader for react

## Nice to have
Since the challenge was timed, there have been many other tasks/work to accomplish more, such as:
Unit testing
Code coverage
Linting
Continuous integration
